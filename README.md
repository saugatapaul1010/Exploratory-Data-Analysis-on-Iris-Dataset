Iris Flower dataset

Toy Dataset: Iris Dataset: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set]

    A simple dataset to learn the basics.
    3 flowers of Iris species. [see images on wikipedia link above]
    1936 by Ronald Fisher.
    Petal and Sepal: http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~petersd/666/html/iris_with_labels.jpg
    Objective: Classify a new flower as belonging to one of the 3 classes given the 4 features.
    Importance of domain knowledge.
    Why use petal and sepal dimensions as features?
    Why do we not use 'color' as a feature?
